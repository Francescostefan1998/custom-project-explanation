    1-     I was thinking about building a beer app (it allows brewer to brew their own beer), there are already several applications like 
     that but i would like as a brewer to add some personalizations in order to make it more dinamic. (limiting the features in order to 
    respect the 4 weeks to build it). if that is a bad idea I am 100% open to do something else, i thought about that to build something 
    different from the usual e-commerce or travel-website. The app will be responsive in mobile as well.

    2-    The user shoud be able to register with credential or google account and be able to login in his profile. In there he can build 
    his own beer with the help of the calculation provided from the application, save his recepy and have access to it whenever he wants
    to login in his own account.

    3-    The front-end main page will direct the user to access the previous beer he made (and eventually modify them), or build a new beer.
    In the building process the application will make the user choose the style of beer in order to provide default suggestion, if the user
    don't want to choose he will still be able to proceed.
    - The raw matrial page/pages will allow the user to select or enter the raw material to make his beer, choose the quantity and correct
    it as he wants, considering the teorethical final result offered from the calculator sistem of the application.
    - The procees page/pages will be descripted by the user by adding sections and timing.
    - The fermentation procees page/pages will be descripted by the user by adding sections and timing and it will be represented in a chart.
    - At the end he can save the results and access and modify it when he need.
    (if I have time I will make also the possibility to download a nice pdf file).
    

    4-   The backend will provide a way to make user register, encript password, login ecc.
         It will provide the most famous 40/50 beer style with the data that that specific style shoud respect(color, water, alchool, 
         bitterness, etc).
         It will provide a list of the main raw materials with his data(%of glucose, alpha acid, ebc etc).
         If the raw materials needed are not in the list the user can still add the values and the front-end calculators
         will perform responding to those values.
         It will store the list of users with reference to a list of his recepie.


   5 -    If the time will allow i will make a section that allows user to comunicate each other (using soket)
        This depends from how many features I want to provide in the calulator and correction of the raw materials which I think it will
        be a really interesting part for me to improve my skills by implementing all these features.
        I am a bit concerned about the style because I don't have much creativity about it but I can take inspiration from other existing app.



    Example of a small part of the calculator: Let's correct the water (the user will be provided with the 7 or 8 most important salt and 
    they will displayed in three colums of values:
    -in the first column he will enter the value of the water he has. and if he doesn't enter the calculator will take as a default value the
    average amout of that element in the water.
    - in the second column there will be displayed the value of the water suggested.
    - in the third column there will be displayed the results of the water he is obtaining from adding the salt(each specific salt he 
    will add, will modify the final water results affecting ph, and the availability of all the other salt in different ways calculated 
    from the calculator ) to his water. 
    when he is happy with that he can save the results(the kind and amount of salts he used, and the result obtained).
    )
